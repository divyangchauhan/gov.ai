The bill would also provide a path to citizenship for those who have served in the military. It would be the first of its kind in the history of the federal government. It was introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and would go through the Senate Judiciary Committee before going to President Obama for a vote. It is expected to be voted on by the end of the year."
